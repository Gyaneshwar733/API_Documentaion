# 
 # Introduction
SeerPortal is a web portal used for accessing all the tools and modules offered in **DataSeers**.

The Seerporatl API is based on RESTful principle, ensuring a standardized and efficient way of interacting 
with the portal's features.

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. 

It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT) and response codes (like 200 for success, 404 for 
not found) to ensure consistent behaviour across all operations.

For security, all requests to the API must be made over **HTTPS**, protecting data during transmission and 
ensuring secure communication between the user and the server.


 # Authentication
The user access is restricted with '**Token**'. Use username and password to authenticate.

Once authenticated, an API key token is generated, which is then used to access the SeerPortal API. This 
token must be included in all subsequent API requests to verify the user's identity and permissions.


 # HTTP Request Methods
The HTTP request methods (also known as verbs) define the type of action the user wants to perform,

For example:
- *GET* - to **Get** data from a resource.
-  *POST* - to **Create** data at a resource.
-  *PUT* â€“ to **Update** data at a resource.


 # Base URL
The base URL is the root address of the API, used as the starting point for all API requests.

It's the foundation of the API's endpoint, and you build on it by adding specific paths to access different 
resources.

For example, if https://api.example.com/v1/ is the base URL, you can get user data by adding **/users** to 
form https://api.example.com/v1/users.


 # Parameters
This section explains the parameters required for each end point. Knowing these is the key to making a 
successful API request.

This includes:
- **Parameter name**- The exact name of parameter as expected by API. It's usually case sensitive. so, make 
sure to use it exactly as shown.
- **Data Type**- The type of data that parameters accept. example: **String** (text), **Integer** (A whole number).
- **Required/ Optional**- Indicates weather the parameters are mandatory or not for the API call.
- **Description**- A brief explanation of what the parameter does and how to use it.


 # Error Handling
The Seerportal API uses standard HTTP response status codes to indicate whether a request was 
successful or not.

If a request is unsuccessful, the response body contains details of the error within an error object to 
provide more information about what went wrong with the request.

This error object helps users understand the issue and take appropriate action.
